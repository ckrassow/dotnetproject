## Project specification

My project idea is a prediction website for the Euro 2024 football tournament. I plan on building the project using .NET for my backend and React for my frontend. I will also be using PostgreSQL as my database. 

The basic idea is for each user to be able to make predictions about different categories regarding the tournament. Examples of different categories are for example one focused on the teams, one on the players and one on the tournament itself. The player predictions for example might include something like "top scorer of the tournament". 

I then intend on adding to this project as I go to make it more advanced. The users should be able to compare themselves to other users in some way. There will be a global leaderboard, but also a friends leaderboard. Possibly some kind of league which users can create and invite people to aswell (although not sure how this would differ from just adding friends and comparing to all your friends instead).
