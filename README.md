## Project specification

My project idea is a prediction website for the Euro 2024 football tournament. I plan on building the project using .NET for my backend and React for my frontend. I will also be using PostgreSQL as my database. 

The basic idea is for each user to be able to make predictions about different categories regarding the tournament. Examples of different categories are for example one focused on the teams, one on the players and one on the tournament itself. The player predictions for example might include something like "top scorer of the tournament". 

I then intend on adding to this project as I go to make it more advanced. Users will be able to create and invite people to their own leagues. The users will be able to compare their predictions to other users. There will be both a global leaderboard and a "league" leaderboard. 

There is some problems involving the project idea that I am aware of already. For example, the tournament does not start until after the course is over. So users will not be able to gather points etc. But I figure I could perhaps expand the project to not only involve predictions but also be more of a hub for the Euro 2024 tournament. I could include brackets, group standings, create pages with information about the teams etc. For user interactivity I am also considering adding some sort of simple quiz style game or perhaps something inspired by the "higher/lower" games that are popular around the web right now.

The prediction idea is the basic fundamental of the web page though, where users will be able to create profiles and make predictions about various things related to the tournament.
